            <br/>
            <p> I'm currently a computer science student at MIT and this is a website I built to learn more about programming in JavaScript.
                 I used Next.js and TailwindCSS to develop the front end and used Firebase and Node.js when making the backend. I've built a few small games, a chat app, an authentication system, a server to keep track of leaderboards, a working blog that I can post to from the website, and a bell schedule app that I used when I was in high school.
            </p>
